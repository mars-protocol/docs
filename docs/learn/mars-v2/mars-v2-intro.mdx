# Mars v2

Mars V1 was already a successful money market. However, Mars V2 is an upgraded version with a credit account that helps the protocol enhance the DeFi experience. It aims to expand the protocol's capabilities by introducing new features and improving existing ones.

Key aspects of Mars V2 include:

- **Enhanced DeFi products**: Earlier Mars V1 had limited lending, borrowing, and yield farming. With Mars V2 we are set to offer a wider range of Defi functionalities, such as spot trading, margin trading, copy trading vaults to imitate and learn from experienced traders, and high-leverage strategies. However, two breakthrough innovations are cross-margined and cross-collateralization accounts. Any on-chain asset can act as collateral, including LPs, and tokens, and every perp is cross-margined.

- **Amplified Leverage**: The new credit account enables users to maximize their leverage by under collateralization. On top of that, using High Leverage Strategy (HLS), you can further increase your leverage up to 10x.

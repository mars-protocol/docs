After you select the Keplr extension for the first time, you will be redirected to a Keplr site where you can either create a new wallet or import an existing wallet. For this tutorial, we will be creating a new wallet.

You will be prompted to securely write down your seed phrase. Write the 12/24-word seed phrase down in a secure and private place and in the proper order.

Losing the seed phrase will lead to loss of the funds kept in the wallet. Do not share your seed phrase with anyone.

Once you've written down your seed phrase, choose a name and password for your wallet. Note your password down in a safe place as this will be required to log in to your wallet interface. If you lose your password, you can retrieve your wallet by importing your seed phrase.

Once complete, click on "Next".

### Step 6: Verify the seed phrase

Mars Protocol is designed to incentivize token holders and contribute to the protocol's growth. By staking your MARS tokens, you actively participate in the governance while, in the future, potentially reducing trading fees.

## Benefits of Staking MARS

- **Stakers Fee Discounts**: Stakers in the future could get discounts on the protocol fees for trading activities within the Mars ecosystem. This provides consistent encouragement to token holders.
- **Participate in Governance**: Stakers have a direct say in shaping the future of the protocol through governance proposals and voting.

## Staking Mechanics

If you have already staked your tokens on Mars Hub, you can unstake them and Stake them on [DAODAO](https://daodao.zone/dao/neutron1pxjszcmmdxwtw9kv533u3hcudl6qahsa42chcs24gervf4ge40usaw3pcr/home). Before staking you must transfer your holdings of MARS tokens on Neutron Blockchain. Once you complete the staking process, you can view and express your opinions and vote for the upcoming governance proposals. 

## Unstaking

If you need to access your staked MARS tokens before the end of the staking period, you can initiate an unstaking process. However, the usual waiting period is 1 day before you can withdraw your tokens.

**What are cookies?**

Cookies are small text files that are sent to your computer to ensure the technical functionality of the website. Delphi Labs Ltd uses cookies in some areas of its web pages to make it easier for you to use the pages and to make them more personalized.

**Terminology**

When trying to understand cookies, it can help to know following terminology.

Cookies installed on your device by the organization running the website you are visiting are known as “first party” cookies.

Cookies installed on your device via the website you are visiting by another organization are termed “third party” cookies. An example is a cookie set by a specialist website analytics company that provides the website owner with data on the numbers of people visiting its website (Cookies for range and usage analysis).

So-called “persistent cookies” remain on your device even after you close your internet browser. They are activated each time you visit the website that created that particular cookie. For example, where a “persistent cookie” is used on a website to remember your login details, you will not need to enter those details each time you visit that website (Functional and preference cookies).

“Session cookies”, by contrast, are temporary and are typically used to enable the website to operate, e.g. by permitting a user to move from page to page without having to log in again. Once you close your browser, all session cookies are deleted (Technically necessary cookies).

“Strictly Necessary Cookies” are cookies without which you would not be able to use this website. For example, Strictly Necessary Cookies adjust the website data transmitted to match your Internet connection, get you to the secure versions of the website, and help provide services you specifically request. If you set your browser to block these cookies, some parts of the website will not work. Strictly Necessary Cookies do not store any personal data.

“Functional cookies” allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced functionality and more personalized features. Depending on context, Functional Cookies may store certain types of personal data as needed to provide functionality.

Moreover, “performance cookies” allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our website, and will not be able to monitor its performance.

1. **About the Site**

The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available third-party information about:

- the Mars Hub
- Mars Outposts
- ![](Aspose.Words.f6715b20-3081-4b6a-9a32-b9314c7daf2b.002.png)![](Aspose.Words.f6715b20-3081-4b6a-9a32-b9314c7daf2b.003.png)the Mars Smart Contract Protocol;

- ![](Aspose.Words.f6715b20-3081-4b6a-9a32-b9314c7daf2b.003.png)tokens that exist and have been or may be made available for withdrawal or “borrowing” by third parties known as “lenders” or “depositors” in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System;
- ![](Aspose.Words.f6715b20-3081-4b6a-9a32-b9314c7daf2b.001.png)third-party smart contract systems that act as ‘borrowers’ in contract-to-contract (C2C) transactions of the Mart Smart Contract System
- ![](Aspose.Words.f6715b20-3081-4b6a-9a32-b9314c7daf2b.001.png)![](Aspose.Words.f6715b20-3081-4b6a-9a32-b9314c7daf2b.001.png)the implied or express fair market prices of tokens, which may be denominated in terms of other tokens; transaction records relating to the Mars Smart Contract System.

The Site also offers interaction methods whereby the User can indicate a transaction the User would like to perform in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System (such as swapping one token for another).

When used in this way, the Site can generate a draft transaction message which the User can independently use in conjunction with a third-party wallet application or device to conduct transactions on Mars Hub or Mars Outposts.
1. ## **About Mars**

The Mars Smart Contract Protocol is software source code freely licensed to the public, which provides a decentralized “credit” protocol through which tokens can be ‘loaned’ and ‘borrowed’, as well as a governance protocol which can govern deployed instances of such protocol. The Mars Smart Contract System is a copy of the Mars Smart Contract Protocol that has been compiled to bytecode and permanently associated with one or more specific public addresses on Mars Hub and Mars Outposts. Through a compatible third-party wallet application or device, Mars Hub Core Node or node compatible with a Mars Outpost, as applicable, any User may pay Mars Hub Validators or other validators on the appropriate blockchain system to operate and record the results of the Mars Smart Contract System in accordance with the User’s instructions, thus effectuating token transactions.
1. ## **Relationship to Mars Smart Contract System**

The Site Operator does not own, operate or control Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or the Mars Smart Contract System. Using Mars Outposts, Mars Hub, or the Mars Smart Contract System does not require use of the Site. The Site aggregates and publishes publicly available information about the Mars Smart Contract System in a user- friendly and convenient format. Such information is also independently available from other sources—for example, a person may directly review Mars transaction history, account balances and the Mars Smart Contract System on a compatible block explorer for a Mars Outpost.

By combining publicly available information with the User’s interactions with the Site, the Site can draft standard transaction messages compatible with the Mars Smart Contract System which are designed to accomplish the User’s operational goals as expressed through the interactions. If the User so wishes, the User may broadcast such messages to Terra in order to initiate token transactions.

All draft transaction messages are delivered by the Site via API to a compatible third-party wallet application or device selected by the User after pressing the “Connect Wallet” (or similar) button on the Site. The User must personally review and authorize all transaction messages that the User wishes to send to Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or other blockchain systems; this requires the User to sign the relevant transaction message with a private cryptographic key inaccessible to the Site. The User-authorized message will then be broadcast to Validators through the wallet application or device and the User may pay a network fee to have the Validators apply the transaction message to the Mars Smart Contract System and record the results on the appropriate blockchain—resulting in a token transaction being completed on that blockchain.

The Site Operator and the Site are not agents or intermediaries of the User, do not store or have access to or control over any tokens, private keys, passwords, accounts or other property of the User, and are not capable of performing transactions or sending transaction messages on behalf of the User. The Site does not hold and cannot purchase, sell or trade any tokens. All transactions relating to the Mars Smart Contract System are effected and recorded solely through the interactions of the User with the respective Validators, who are not under the control of or affiliated with the Site Operator or the Site.
1. ## **Disclaimers and Disclosures**

[Important disclaimers and disclosures regarding the subject material of the Site can be found on the Mars Disclaimers/Disclosures article on Medium. You should familiarize yourself with these disclaimers and](https://mars-protocol.medium.com/mars-disclaimers-disclosures-f44cc7c54a33) disclosures and conduct your own thorough due diligence into the Mars Smart Contract Protocol and Mars Smart Contract System before using the Site.

Users should not take or refrain from taking any action in reliance on any information contained in these Terms or provided by or on behalf of Site Operator. Before Users make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving the Site, Users should seek independent professional advice from persons licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.
1. ## **Limited Survival Period for Claims**

Any claim or cause of action a User may have or acquire in connection with the Site or any of the other matters contemplated by these Terms shall survive for the shorter of, and may be brought against Site Operator solely prior to: (a) the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto; and (b) the date that is six months after the date on which the facts and circumstances giving rise to such claim or cause of action first arose.
1. ## **Third-Party Offerings and Content**

References, links or referrals to or connections with or reliance on third-party resources, products, services or content, including smart contracts developed or operated by third parties, may be provided to Users in connection with the Site. In addition, third parties may offer promotions related to the Site. Site Operator does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any activities of or resources, products, services, content or promotions owned, controlled, operated or sponsored by third parties. If Users access any such resources, products, services or content or participate in any such promotions, Users do so solely at their own risk. Each User hereby expressly waives and releases Site Operator from all liability arising from User’s use of any such resources, products, services or content or participation in any such promotions.

User further acknowledges and agrees that Site Operator shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such resources, products, services, content or promotions from third parties.
1. ## **Certain Uses and Risks of Blockchain Technology**

1. **Use of Blockchain Technology.** Site Operator or third parties may utilize experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain technologies, including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, “smart contracts,” consensus algorithms, voting systems and distributed, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks or systems in connection with the Site or systems about which the Site provides information. Each User acknowledges and agrees that such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application of existing law thereto.
1. **Certain Risks of Blockchain Technology.** The technologies relevant to the Site depend on public peer-to-peer networks such as Mars Hub and the Mars Outposts that are not under the control or influence of Site Operator and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. Such technologies include the Mars Smart Contract System, which (other than based on any multisignature arrangements which may be described in the [Mars FUD Bible](https://mars-protocol.medium.com/mars-disclaimers-disclosures-f44cc7c54a33)) Site Operator has no ability to change, other than ceasing to display information about certain “smart contracts” or adding information about new “smart contracts”. Users are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used in connection with the Mars Smart Contract System. Site Operator will not be able to restore or issue any refund in respect of property lost or frozen due to loss of private keys or otherwise. If a User is not able to spend or use tokens due to loss or theft of the corresponding private key or otherwise, a User will be unable to enjoy the benefits of such tokens.
1. **Certain Risks of Smart Contract Technology.** Digital assets relevant to the Site depend on the Mars Smart Contract System or other smart contracts deployed to Mars Outposts or other blockchain systems, or on the Mars Hub, each of which may be coded or deployed by persons other than Site Operator. Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, and other blockchain systems, and, once deployed to a blockchain system, the code of smart contracts, including the Mars Smart Contract System, typically cannot be modified, or can only be modified in limited ways. In the event that the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System or other smart contracts or blockchain systems are adversely affected by malfunctions, bugs, defects, malfunctions, hacking, theft, attacks, negligent coding or design choices, or changes to the applicable protocol rules, Users may be exposed to a risk of total loss and forfeiture of all relevant digital assets. Site Operator assumes no liability or responsibility for any of the foregoing matters.
1. **Asset Prices.** The fiat-denominated prices and value in public markets of cryptocurrencies and tokens (including $MARS) have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and may be highly volatile. As relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based assets are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods and services. A significant portion of demand for these assets is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market value of any token may decline below the price for which a User acquires such asset through the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts or Mars Smart Contract System or on any other system. User acknowledges and agrees that the costs and speeds of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts and Mars Smart Contract System are variable and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability to access or use any tokens.

1. **Regulatory Uncertainty.** Blockchain technologies and digital assets are subject to many legal and regulatory uncertainties, and the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System or any tokens could be adversely impacted by one or more regulatory or legal inquiries, actions, suits, investigations, claims, fines or judgments, which could impede or limit the ability of User to continue the use and enjoyment of such assets and technologies.
1. **Cryptography Risks**. Cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to blockchain systems, the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System or tokens, including the theft, loss or inaccessibility thereof.
1. **Fork Handling.** Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, the Mars Smart Contract System, and all tokens may be subject to “forks.” Forks occur when some or all persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client that: (i) changes the protocol rules in backwards-compatible or backwards-incompatible manner that affects which transactions can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters relating to the future operation of the protocol; or (ii) reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some forks are “contentious” and thus may result in two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original. Site Operator may not be able to anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or outcome of forks, and does not assume any risk, liability or obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Site Operator does not assume any responsibility to notify a User of pending, threatened or completed forks. Site Operator will respond (or refrain from responding) to any forks in such manner as Site Operator determines in its sole and absolute discretion, and Site Operator shall not have any duty or obligation or liability to a User if such response (or lack of such response) acts to a User detriment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Site Operator’s possible and permissible responses to a fork may include: (i) honoring the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and tokens on both chains; (ii) honoring the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and tokens on only one of the chains; (iii) honoring the Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and tokens in different respects or to a different extent on both chains; or (iv) any other response or policy or procedure, as determined by Site Operator in its sole and absolute discretion. Each User assumes full responsibility to independently remain apprised of and informed about possible forks, and to manage the User’s own interests and risks in connection therewith.
1. **Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies.** The Mars Hub, Mars Outposts, Mars Smart Contract System and other relevant blockchain systems and smart contracts are public software utilities which are accessible directly through any compatible node or indirectly through any compatible “wallet” application (such as the web browser plugin Keplr) which interacts with such a node. Interacting with the Mars Smart Contract System does not require use of the Site, but the Site provides a convenient and user- friendly method of reading and displaying data from the Mars Smart Contract System and generating standard transaction messages compatible with the Mars Smart Contract System. Because the Site does not provide wallet software or nodes for Mars Hub or Mars Outposts, such software constitutes an essential third-party or user dependency without which the Mars Smart Contract System cannot be utilized, and tokens cannot be traded or used. Furthermore, the site may utilize APIs, middleware and servers of Site Operator or third parties, and Site Operator does not guarantee the continued operation, maintenance, availability or security of any of the foregoing dependencies.

1. ## **Tax Issues**

The tax consequences of purchasing, selling, holding, transferring or locking tokens or otherwise utilizing the Mars Smart Contract System are uncertain, may vary by jurisdiction and may be adverse to a User. Site Operator has undertaken no due diligence or investigation into such tax consequences, assumes no obligation or liability to optimize the tax consequences to any person and is not providing any tax advice.
1. ## **Legal Limitations on Disclaimers**

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in these Terms may not apply in full to specific Users. The disclaimers and limitations of liability provided in these terms shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
1. ## **Officers, Directors, Etc.**

All provisions of these Terms which disclaim or limit obligations or liabilities of Site Operator shall also apply, *mutatis mutandis,* to the officers, directors, members, employees, independent contractors, agents, stockholders, debtholders and affiliates of Site Operator.

1. ## **Indemnification**

Each User shall defend, indemnify, compensate, reimburse and hold harmless Site Operator (and each of its officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to (a) User’s use of, or conduct in connection with, the Site; (b) User’s violation of these Terms or any other applicable policy or contract of Site Operator; or (c) User’s violation of any rights of any other person or entity.

1. ## **Governing law; Dispute Resolution**

1. **Governing Law**

These Terms shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands (irrespective of the choice of laws principles) as to all matters, including matters of validity, construction, effect, enforceability, performance and remedies. Although the Site may be available in other jurisdictions, each User hereby acknowledges and agrees that such availability shall not be deemed to give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction over Site Operator in any forum outside the British Virgin Islands.
1. ## **Settlement Negotiations**

If a User has a potential legal dispute, claim or cause of action against Site Operator, the User shall first (prior to initiating any litigation proceedings) contact Site Operator by sending an email to <delphi_labs_contracts@delphidigital.io> describing the nature of the potential dispute, claim or cause of action and providing all relevant documentation and evidence thereof. If so elected by Site Operator, User shall use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a settlement of any such legal dispute, claim or cause of action within 60 days of the delivery of such email. Any such dispute, claim or cause of action that is not finally resolved by a binding, written settlement agreement within such 60 days shall be brought and resolved exclusively in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 7.

1. ## **Agreement to Binding, Exclusive Arbitration**

1. **Mandatory Binding Arbitration.** All claims, disputes and controversies directly or indirectly arising out of or in connection with or directly or indirectly relating to these Terms or any of the matters or transactions contemplated by these Terms (for the avoidance of doubt, including any claim seeking to invalidate, or alleging that, all or any part of these Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable) (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively, “ ***Disputes*** ”) shall be resolved by confidential, binding arbitration to be seated in the British Virgin Islands and conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “ ***Rules*** ”). The arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules. The award or decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties and the parties expressly waive any right under the laws of any jurisdiction to appeal or otherwise challenge the award, ruling or decision of the arbitrator. The judgment of any award or decision may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary. If the Company elects to have a Dispute resolved by arbitration pursuant to this provision, no party hereto shall (or shall permit its representatives to) commence, continue or pursue any Dispute in any court; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this provision and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which the Company is entitled at law or in equity, and the parties hereto hereby waive the requirement of any posting of a bond in connection with such injunctive relief or specific performance.
1. **Waiver of Jury Trial.** The parties hereby acknowledge, represent and warrant that they understand that:

(i) there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and, absent this mandatory provision, the parties would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial concerning Disputes; (ii) in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation; (iii) the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court; and (iv) court review of an arbitration award is limited. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any action, suit or other legal proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the transactions contemplated hereby.

1. **Confidentiality of Arbitration.** Except to the extent necessary to enforce their respective rights under these Terms or as otherwise required by applicable law, the parties undertake to maintain confidentiality as to the existence and events of the arbitration proceedings and as to all submissions, correspondence and evidence relating to the arbitration proceedings. This provision shall survive the termination of the arbitral proceedings.

1. ## **Court Jurisdiction**

To the extent that any court is required to weigh on the enforceability of Section 7.3, to enforce any judgment of the arbitrator, then, without limiting Section 7.3 or any other provision of this Agreement, the User (A) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the British Virgin Islands for such purpose; (B) agrees not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding arising in connection with or based upon this instrument or the matters contemplated by this instrument except before the courts of the British Virgin Islands, and (C) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this instrument or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not be enforced in or by such court.
1. ## **Class Action Waiver**

1. **No Class Actions Permitted.** All Users hereby agree that any arbitration or other permitted action with respect to any Dispute shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the Users expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. USERS SHALL BRING CLAIMS AGAINST SITE OPERATOR OTHER ONLY IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
1. **Agreements if Class Action Waiver Unenforceable.** If any court or arbitrator makes a final, binding and non-appealable determination that the class action waiver set forth in this Section 7.5 is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void with respect to any Dispute that would thus be required to be resolved by arbitration on a class basis, and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate such Dispute. In the event that, as a result of the application of the immediately preceding sentence or otherwise, any Dispute is not subject to arbitration, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware and to accept service of process by mail with respect to such Dispute, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available with respect to such Dispute.

1. ## **California End-User Consumer Rights**

In accordance with Cal. Civ. Code Sec. 1789.3, if a User is a California State resident, the User may file grievances and complaints regarding the Site with the California Department of Consumer Affairs, Consumer Information Division; 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834 or by phone at 800-952-5210; or by email to: <dca@dca.ca.gov>.

A User shall not assign any of a User rights or delegate any of a User liabilities or obligations under these Terms to any other person without Site Operator’s advance written consent. Site Operator may freely assign, transfer or delegate its rights, obligations and liabilities under these Terms to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
1. ## **Severability**

In the event that any provision of these Terms, or the application of any such provision to any person or set of circumstances, shall be determined by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent: (a) the remainder of these Terms, and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law; and (b) Site Operator shall have the right to modify these Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consumed as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

1. ## **Force Majeure.**

Site Operator shall not incur any liability or penalty for not performing any act or fulfilling any duty or obligation hereunder or in connection with the matters contemplated hereby by reason of any occurrence that is not within its control (including any provision of any present or future law or regulation or any act of any governmental authority, any act of God or war or terrorism, any epidemic or pandemic, or the unavailability, disruption or malfunction of the Internet, the World Wide Web or any other electronic network, the Mars Hub or Mars Outposts or Mars Smart Contract System or any aspect thereof, or any consensus attack, or hack, or denial-of-service or other attack on the foregoing or any aspect thereof, or on the other software, networks and infrastructure that enables Site Operator to provide the Site), it being understood that Site Operator shall use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with accepted practices in the industries in which Site Operator operates, as applicable, to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.
1. ## **Amendments and Modifications**

These Terms may only be amended, modified, altered or supplemented by or with the written consent of Site Operator. Site Operator reserves, the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend, modify, alter or supplement these Terms from time to time. The most current version of these Terms will be posted on the Site. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon the modified Agreement being posted to the Site. A User shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.

Each User hereby waives any right such User may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Use of the Site by a User after any modification of these Terms constitutes the User’s acceptance of the modified terms and conditions. If a User does not agree to any such modifications, the User must immediately stop using the Site.
1. ## **No Implied Waivers**

No failure or delay on the part of Site Operator in the exercise of any power, right, privilege or remedy under these Terms shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. Site Operator shall not be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of these Terms, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under these Terms, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of Site Operator, and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

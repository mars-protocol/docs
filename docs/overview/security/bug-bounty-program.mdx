**Red Bank**: A money market protocol for lending and borrowing.

**Maximum Bounty: $100,000**

We offer competitive rewards for identified vulnerabilities. The severity of the vulnerability determines the reward amount.

- All reports must include a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability and its impact on in-scope assets. Code is required, not just explanations.
